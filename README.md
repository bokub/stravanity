Stravanity is a simple tool designed to help you explore Strava segments near you, and find the **easiest ones to beat**.

Visit [stravanity.vercel.app](https://stravanity.vercel.app/) to try it.

### There are 2 ways to beat a Strava segment

1.  #### Local Legend

    The Local Legend achievement is awarded to the athlete who completes a given segment the most over a rolling 90-day period regardless of pace or speed.

    > Stravanity computes the total distance you need to run in order to beat the current local legend

2.  #### Course Record

    The Course Record achievement is awarded to the fastest athlete to date on a segmentâ€™s overall leaderboard.

    > Stravanity computes the average speed you need to run in order to beat the current course record

### How to use Stravanity

Just explore the map to load segments. Use a high zoom level to load less popular (and probably easier) segments, then zoom out to see everything you've loaded.

Stravanity will show you a list of the segments visible on the map, ordered from the easiest to the most difficult

### About Strava API limits

Because of the Strava API limits, Stravanity can only load 100 segments every 15 minutes, with up to 1,000 segments per day. These limits are shared by all users.

The 15-minute limit is reset at natural 15-minute intervals corresponding to 0, 15, 30 and 45 minutes after the hour, and the daily limit resets at midnight UTC.

If you reach one of these limits, **the only thing you can do is to wait** and come back later to load new segments.
