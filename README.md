Stravanity is a simple tool designed to help you explore Strava segments near you, and find the **easiest ones to beat**.

Visit [stravanity.vercel.app](https://stravanity.vercel.app/) to try it.

### There are 2 ways to beat a Strava segment

1.  #### Local Legend

    The Local Legend achievement is awarded to the athlete who completes a given segment the most over a rolling 90-day period regardless of pace or speed.

    > Stravanity computes the total distance you need to run in order to beat the current local legend

2.  #### Course Record

    The Course Record achievement is awarded to the fastest athlete to date on a segment’s overall leaderboard.

    > Stravanity computes the average speed you need to run in order to beat the current course record

### How to use Stravanity

Just explore the map to load segments. Use a high zoom level to load less popular (and probably easier) segments, then zoom out to see everything you've loaded.

Stravanity will show you a list of the segments visible on the map, ordered from the easiest to the most difficult
