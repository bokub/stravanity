# About Strava API Limits

Because of the Strava API limits, Stravanity can only load 300 segments every 15 minutes, with up to 3,000 segments per day. These limits are shared **by all users**.

The 15-minute limit is reset at natural 15-minute intervals corresponding to 0, 15, 30 and 45 minutes after the hour, and the daily limit resets at midnight UTC.

If you reach one of these limits, **the only thing you can do is to wait** and come back later to load new segments.
